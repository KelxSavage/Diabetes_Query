A Study on How hospitals managed care for Diabetic patients (1998 - 2008)

### INTRODUCTION
Diabetes is one of the _top 10_ causes of death globally according to World Health Organization. The number of new patients and re-admitted patients is raising year by year significantly. Therefore, the pressure for hospital management is also increased to be able to serve patients in all conditions. Some of the concerns from the management are:

* The hospital's performance in managing the hospital capacity for all patients.

* Budgeting the procedures and specialists for each patient case.

* How patients are treated regardless of their race and identification for better care.

* The success rate for emergency cases.

* Summarize patientsâ€™ history for the overall views.

This project used data from _130_ medical clinics for Diabetes in the United States from 1999 to 2008. It is not a recent dataset, but it shows some good insights and can be used for future prediction. After the analysis, I explored:

Most patients stayed less than 7 days and a maximum of 14 days in the hospital.
There were several lab procedures and medications for each patient with different specialists which could be considered to reduce the cost if necessary.
As an immigrant country, the United States has people from many ethnic backgrounds. The analysis found that there was _fair_ treatment at healthcare facilities with similar procedures and lab work.
The longer the patients stay at the hospital, the more lab procedures are required.
Around 25% of patients needed emergency services but stayed shorter at the hospital which reflects the good management system.
